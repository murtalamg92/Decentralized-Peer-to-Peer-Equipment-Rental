# Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Equipment Rental

A blockchain-based platform that connects equipment owners with potential renters in a secure, transparent, and trustless environment. This decentralized application (dApp) eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and creates a self-governing marketplace for equipment rental.

## Overview

This platform revolutionizes equipment rental by leveraging blockchain technology to create direct peer-to-peer connections. Equipment owners can list their items, set rental terms, and receive secure payments, while renters can find needed equipment, build reputation through responsible use, and provide verifiable feedback. Smart contracts automate the entire rental process from listing to return.

## Core Components

- Equipment categorization and searchability
- Availability calendar and scheduling management
- Maintenance history tracking
- Pricing structure definition (hourly, daily, weekly rates)
- Insurance and compliance documentation
- Equipment location data with optional geofencing

### Rental Agreement Contract

Handles the creation, execution, and enforcement of rental terms between parties.

**Features:**
- Customizable rental terms and conditions
- Dynamic pricing based on duration and season
